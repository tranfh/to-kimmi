      <h2> Shakespeare Sonnet 109 </h2>
      <p> O, never say that I was false of heart, </p>
      <p> Though absence seem'd my flame to qualify! </p>
      <p> As easy might I from myself depart </p>
      <p> As from my soul, which in thy breast doth lie: </p>
      <p> That is my home of love: if I have rang'd, </p>
      <p> Like him that travels I return again, </p>
      <p> Just to the time, not with the time exchang'd --, </p>
      <p> So that myself bring water for my stain. </p>
      <p> Never believe, though in my nature reign'd </p>
      <p> All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood, </p>
      <p> That it could so preposterously be stain'd, </p>
      <p> To leave for nothing all thy sum of good; </p>
      <p> For nothing this wide universe I call, </p>
      <p> Save thou, my rose; in it thou art my all.</p>
      <p>Basically... I know I'll screw up sometimes...</p>
      <p>And I should be around more</p>
      <p>But you're always on my mind and are special to me :) special needs</p>
      <p>Happy Valentine's Day!</p>
